One TopCoder problem a day

Problems are listed by their room number. Numerical suffix represents second, third, versions, etc (implying original version failed miserably). By default, the medium problem was attempted (usually 500 points). An 'e' suffix means the easy problem was attemped and 'h' means hard. Problems are written in most Python with occasional Java.
